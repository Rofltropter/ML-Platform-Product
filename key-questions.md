# Key Questions for the ML Platform Scenario (pre-Interview)

- What would you consider as the key distinguishing factors between The Brain's OPUS and this scenario's ML Platform? I've noticed quite a few intersections between the two, however have also seen it branch into Galileo's functionality among others.

- To continue along the above, would this scenario be better viewed as a Platform Suite; spanning a tight range of overlapping services (ie. Product Ideation->Production Compute Hosting, Platform MLOps,  On-Demand ML Development Tooling with Ease-of-Use optimization, Data Preparation Services, Global Model Discovery Services, etc.)?


- For the platform hyperparameter tuning service, is there already a global view of tuning run data across hyperparameter selection rounds, or do ML Developers manually aggregate the optimization data across rounds?






# Key Questions for Position (during Interview)

- I've been vying to attend GTC on RBC's behalf for quite some time now - with minimal luck due to COVID travel restrictions. Would this be an opportunity I could pursue at Borealis? I see major benefits in ensuring Borealis remains a consistent partner of NVIDIA and its vast customer base - good PR if we strengthen ties and have members of our org speak at their conferences.

-What is the training budget for attending courses and writing certificates?
