# Purpose
In exercising the given Scenario across all angles of problem scopes available in the Developer, Engineering, and Business domains, we can build a condensed list of problem statements to tackle.

With this, we create the core vision, and the quintessential pillars of success that this platform suite and its surrogate parts must be bound to delivering.


## Problem Statements


*"Modern ML development teams experiment, build, and productionize ML products from ML platforms."*

### Realization: The Workflow from Ideation to Production Must be Realized Within the Platform's Core Services

*"Platform teams need to engineer the ML development lifecycle into orchestrated steps that can accelerate a products team's ability to deliver value to customers faster with more ease and at higher quality."*

### Realization: The Simplicity of User Experience is Paramount; A Successful Platform Reduces Both Complexity and Repetition    

*"ML Platforms need scalable and reliable access to data."*

### Realization: To Efficiently Access and

*"..GPU infrastructure with comprehensive job scheduling keeping private cluster utilization high and public cloud-optimized"*

### Realization:

*"..they need tools and services that help manage training pipelines, track, log, and report on experiments, and streamline the release of models to production for many flavours of production inference"*

### Realization: Innovation requires the tools of creative process; 

*"..lead the platform product vision for three groups of software engineers and architects specializing in Data, Infrastructure, and ML software development."*
