# Purpose
In exercising the given Scenario across all angles of problem scopes available in the Developer, Engineering, and Business domains, we can build a condensed list of problem statements to tackle.

With this, we create the core vision, and the quintessential pillars of success that this platform suite and its surrogate parts must be bound to delivering.


## Problem Statements

1. ***"Modern ML development teams experiment, build, and productionize ML products from ML platforms."***

2. ***"Platform teams need to engineer the ML development lifecycle into orchestrated steps that can accelerate a products team's ability to deliver value to customers faster with more ease and at higher quality."***

3. ***"ML Platforms need scalable and reliable access to data."***

4. ***"..GPU infrastructure with comprehensive job scheduling keeping private cluster utilization high and public cloud-optimized"***

5. ***"..they need tools and services that help manage training pipelines, track, log, and report on experiments, and streamline the release of models to production for many flavours of production inference"***

6. ***"..lead the platform product vision for three groups of software engineers and architects specializing in Data, Infrastructure, and ML software development."***

## Pillars of Platform success

## 1. *Pillar: End to End Coverage of ML Workflow* - Realization: The Workflow from Ideation to Production Must be Realized Within the Platform's Core Services

***"Modern ML development teams experiment, build, and productionize ML products from ML platforms."***


### 2. *Pillar: Developer Ease-of-Use* - Realization: The Simplicity of User Experience is Paramount; A Successful Platform Reduces Both Complexity and Repetition    

***"Platform teams need to engineer the ML development lifecycle into orchestrated steps that can accelerate a products team's ability to deliver value to customers faster with more ease and at higher quality."***


### 3. *Pillar: Data Availability* - Realization: Data Must be Distributed and Collected in a Readily Accessible and Growth-resilient Manner

***"ML Platforms need scalable and reliable access to data."***


### 4. *Pillar: Compute Availability & Diversity* - Realization: The Customer Base must find the Platform Intelligently Designed for the myriad of diverse compute and environment requests with due consideration to business criticality

***"..GPU infrastructure with comprehensive job scheduling keeping private cluster utilization high and public cloud-optimized"***


### 5. *Pillar: Enable The Creatives* - Realization: Innovation requires the tools of creative process; managing

***"..they need tools and services that help manage training pipelines, track, log, and report on experiments, and streamline the release of models to production for many flavours of production inference"***


### 6. *Pillar: Human Centered Design & Management* - Realization: The Vector Of Solution Approach And Team Organization Is Core to Platform Success

***"..lead the platform product vision for three groups of software engineers and architects specializing in Data, Infrastructure, and ML software development."***
